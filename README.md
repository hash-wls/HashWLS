The datasets and source code of #WLS are for Simple and Efficient Hash Kernels for Graphs with Continuous Attributes.

The steps of running the experiments:

Preparation work

1. compile svmtrain in libsvm-matlab by referring to libsvm-matlab/matlab/README
2. put the mex file in the same directory as 'main.m'
Graph classification

run classfication.m
All the results are generated under the directory, 'results/'

Parameter Sensitivity

run draw_parameters.m
